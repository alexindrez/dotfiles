     robyn can retest this now. an email will only be sent out
     for a "new" abandoned cart, and it is labelled as "new" if a new
     user adds something to a cart for the first time, or if an
     existing user clears their cart with a purchase and then starts a
     new one. removing items from a cart and adding new ones keeps the
     same cart and never sends an email.

     she can test it now with two options: 1) she uses her existing
     promo test account as long as she completes the purchase of her
     current cart and then starts a brand new one to abandon and test
     or 2) she creates a new account with an email address she has
     access to, but we will need to change the group of the account
     after it is created AND before she adds anything to the cart.
