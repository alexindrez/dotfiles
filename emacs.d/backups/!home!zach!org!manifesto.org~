** purpose

This document is a formal declaration of the things I will achieve in the coming year. Every year on the day of my birth I will create a new set of personal challenges. And I better complete them by the time the next year rolls around. As Henry David Thoreau said:

> You cannot dream yourself into a character;
> you must hammer and forge yourself into one.
>
> 	- Henry David Thoreau

The only stipulation for the goals is that they be SMART:

- _S_ : Specific
- _M_ : Measurable
- _A_ : Attainable
- _R_ : Realistic
- _T_ : Timed

A specific goal isn't vague. It is clear enough to be understood in scope and purpose. A measurable goal isn't nebulous. I will know exactly where the finish line is and exactly when I have crossed it. An attainable goal isn't impossible. It is an obviously feasible achievement. A realistic goal isn't irrational. I have the time and resources for its completion. And by the nature of their yearly basis, these goals are given a timeline for their creation.
